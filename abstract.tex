Backscatter communication enables ultra-low
power wireless transmissions, and is attractive
for devices operating on harvested energy. Ambient backscatter
takes the concept further forward, by leveraging
ambient wireless signals like
television signals as both source of power
and carrier signal. Existing state-of-the-art
ambient backscatter systems demonstrate ability to 
achieve tag-to-tag communication under conditions when
signal strength of ambient signal is sufficiently
strong.  In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible
to backscatter even weak signals, when received using
a low cost software defined radio receiver. Our initial results 
demonstrate that the strength of ambient television signals is good
enough in most parts of a mid-sized swedish city for the system
to operate, and also communicate.
