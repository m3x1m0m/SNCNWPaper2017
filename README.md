[Paper](https://github.com/m3x1m0m/SNCNWPaper2017/blob/master/paper/paper.pdf) about television signal backscattering using the RTL2832 as a receiver
prepared for the Swedish National Computer Networking Workshop.

## Abstract 

Ambient backscatter communication enables ultra-
low power wireless transmissions and is hence attractive for
networking devices which operate on harvested energy. The data
to be sent is modulated on an ambient signal, such as TV
signals. Tag-to-tag backscatter communication requires rather
strong ambient signals to achieve acceptable error rates and
range. In this paper, we present a design and implementation of
a backscatter receiver on a extremely low-cost software defined
radio plattform (RTL-SDR), achieving higher sensitivity than
state-of-the-art backscatter tags and thus enabling wide area
ambient backscatter communication from low-power tags. Our
measurements show that the TV signal is strong enough in most
parts of a mid-sized Swedish city for our system to operate and
communicate.
